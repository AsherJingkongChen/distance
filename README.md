## Hello Rustaceans!
This is a Rust library. Here you can do:
1. Add this crate as a dependency of your Rust project:
```shell
cargo add floating-distance
```

2. Check out the [documentation](https://docs.rs/floating-distance) and
[source codes](https://github.com/AsherJingkongChen/floating-distance.git) (click the badges above for more information)

3. Clone the GitHub repository and run the examples:
```shell
cargo run --example default
```

## Examples
1. Measure the cosine similarity between two vectors `v0` and `v1`
```rust
use floating_distance::*;

fn main() {
  let v0: &[f32] = &[1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0];
  let v1: &[f32] = &[2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0];
  let metric = Metric::Cosine;
  let result = metric.measure::<f32>(v0, v1);
  let expectation: f32 = 14.0 / (4.0 * 4.0);

  assert_eq!(result, expectation);
}
```

### What's special about SIMD?
SIMD is the acronym for **S**ingle **I**nstruction **M**ultiple **D**ata

Modern CPUs have special instructions. We can use them to accelerate vector computations!

### How to enable SIMD?
You can enable `simd` feature in this crate by the following steps:
1. Specify `features = ["simd"]` in `Cargo.toml` manifest:
```ini
[dependencies]
floating-distance = { version = "*", features = ["simd"] }
```
2. Compile with Rust nightly version. You can add this to `rust-toolchain.toml`, which is next to `Cargo.toml`:
```ini
[toolchain]
channel = "nightly"
```
3. **(Optional)** Choose the SIMD instruction sets which are supported by the target architecture. You can use `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable and `-C target-feature` compiler option like these:
```shell
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+ssse3" cargo build
```
```shell
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+avx,+sse3" cargo build --release
```
You can find all target features of Rust by this:
```shell
rustc --print target-features
```

### How powerful is SIMD?
I have run a simple benchmark on my laptop (architecture: `aarch64-apple-darwin`).
The SIMD instruction set is NEON.

Let's check out the results first!

- SIMD vs No SIMD (single-precision floating-point type):
```log
no_simd: 198,306 ns/iter (+/- 5,173)
simd:    18,430 ns/iter (+/- 655)
```
Type | Avarage time (ns/iter) | Rate (relative)
--- | --- | ---
No SIMD | 198306 | 1.00
SIMD | 18430 | 10.76

As the data shown, we can see that SIMD can improve the performance significantly!

You can also benchmark it by repeating the following steps:
1. Clone the repository and change it to the current directory
2. Check target features in `.cargo/config.toml`
3. Run this command:
```shell
(cargo +nightly bench -p benchmarks-no-simd &&
 cargo +nightly bench -p benchmarks-simd) 2> /dev/null
```

### Note for SIMD feature
1. This feature is built by experimental features of Rust standard library, `portable-simd`.
2. If a program is built with target features which are not supported by the target architecture, it may lead to runtime errors.
